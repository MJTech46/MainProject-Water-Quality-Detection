# 💧 MainProject-Water-Quality-Detection

Harnessing AI and refractive index to detect water quality and deliver smart purification guidance.

## 📘 Overview

This repository tracks the development of my academic main project focused on **AI-driven water quality detection**. By leveraging **refractive index measurements** and intelligent algorithms, the system aims to assess water purity and recommend appropriate purification methods.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a sensor-based system to measure water's refractive index.
- Use AI models to interpret sensor data and classify water quality.
- Provide actionable purification guidance based on detected parameters.
- Explore integration with other metrics like TDS and turbidity for enhanced accuracy.

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools

- **Python** for AI model development and data processing  
- **Arduino / Raspberry Pi** for sensor interfacing  
- **Machine Learning** (e.g., decision trees, SVMs)  
- **OpenCV / SciPy** for optical data analysis  
- **LaTeX** for documentation and report generation
